This is a simplified clone of 99dresses.com (a defunct site that used
allowed users to rent dresses).

There are cats and they can be rented for time periods in days.
There are users, who own cat(s) and can put in requests to rent other users'
cat(s).
Each cat must be owned by a user.

This is the second version where users can log in and create cats, create
requests to rent other users' cats, and approve/deny rental requests for his or
her own cat(s). A user cannot rent his or her own cat(s).
